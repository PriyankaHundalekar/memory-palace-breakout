# Kiro Development Notes

This directory contains Kiro-specific configuration and development artifacts for the AI Snake Retro project.

## Project Overview
- **Theme**: Retro Revival with Modern AI Twist
- **Game**: Classic Snake with intelligent AI opponent
- **Technology**: HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, CSS
- **AI Features**: Pattern recognition, adaptive strategy, predictive behavior

## Development Process with Kiro
Kiro accelerated development by:
1. Rapid project scaffolding and structure setup
2. Complex AI logic implementation with pattern analysis
3. Retro UI styling with Windows 95 aesthetics
4. Game engine architecture with collision detection
5. Real-time AI decision making and learning algorithms

## Key Features Implemented
- **AI Brain**: Analyzes player patterns and adapts strategy
- **Complex Logic**: Pathfinding, prediction, and decision weighting
- **Retro Styling**: Authentic Windows 95 UI components
- **Modern Enhancements**: Smooth animations and visual effects
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes
